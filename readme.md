Cases differ substantially in the time required for a fair and timely adjudication, not all cases make the same demands upon judicial system resources. Thus, they need not be subject to the same processing requirements. The concept of Case Flow Management for High Court and Subordinate Courts was first introduced through the judgment of the Supreme Court of India in the case of Salem Advocate Bar Association v. Union of India, following which the Model Draft Rules were proposed by the Law Commission, Jagannadha Rao Committee, wherein model case management rules endorsed by the Supreme Court also containing timelines for different case types, the upper limit of which is two years were proposed. Problem Statement/Challenge: Computerization has failed to improve the case scheduling process. However, solving some administrative problems through the aid of technology could reduce the constraints under which judges work and ensure the timely listing of cases thus aiding the speedy disposal of cases. A 'Differentiated Case Flow Management(DCM) system would enable a court to prioritize cases and the recognition that many cases can and should proceed through the court system at a faster pace than others if appropriate pathways are provided. Objective/Expected Outcome: Under a DCM system, cases do not wait for disposition simply on the basis of the chronological order of their filing. This would greatly aid in minimizing and making more predictable the time between case events more and aid efficient disposal of cases.

## 10. **Use of Digital Technology to calculate water footprints for different daily use items.**
The water footprint measures the amount of water used to produce each of the goods and services we use. The water footprint helps us understand for what purposes our limited freshwater resources are being consumed and polluted. The impact of it depends on where the water is taken from and when if it comes from a place where water is already scarce, the consequences can be significant and require action. The increase in the amount of non- available water due to pollution and scarce groundwater level has added more water footprints, at the community as well as at the personal levels. An increased water footprint directly affects the health and future of the citizens. Preventing severe drought in water-stressed areas is only going to be possible if water is used with more care and efficiency, this can be done if we have readily available data on water footprints. Hence by using digital technologies like AI, Big Data, Blockchain, etc, and computer languages, a user-friendly app or website may be developed which can provide the water footprints of different items/ final products we use in daily life by feeding little inputs or just by scanning through the camera like Google lens. The app should support local languages, this will ensure pan-India usage and sensitize the people about the water footprints of items they use in daily life.

One of the major challenges facing is the high level of water loss in distribution networks. Non-Revenue Water (NRW) is defined as the difference between the amount of water put into the distribution system and the amount of water recovered from consumers. NRW is a good indicator of water utility performance; In addition, available NRW data are often found problematic, suspicious, inaccurate, or provide only partial information. Hence, there is a need to develop a system or technology to trace and tackle non-revenue water and convert it into revenue water using digital methods. This will save water as well as increase profitability and improves the return on investment w.r.t water distribution networks.

## 12. **Projection of the extent of inundation corresponding to the forecasts of flood levels in a river.**
Many states in India are regularly affected by flooding especially in monsoon season. Central Water Commission (CWC) issues flood warnings in all flood-prone districts based on the regularly measured water gauge level. Flood warnings are issued by CWC to the state administration, whenever the gauge levels cross the danger mark. In all such cases, the severity of the problem is essentially indicated in terms of flood levels. However, the major concern of the state administration is regarding the difficulty faced in assessing the spatial extent of flooding for mapping rescue and relief works. Large volumes of imagery corresponding to varied flood inundations are expected to be available with NRSA and other freely assessable sources. The past imageries corresponding to a specific forecast site can be collected and each imagery be stamped with the observed water level of that particular date and time. An AI-ML-based GIS application can be developed to process the available imageries for projecting new imageries using suitable interpolation/extrapolation of 2D information corresponding to specific flood levels within a given range. The participants of SIH are expected to develop the above-mentioned application using open-source software and demonstrate its utility for any one of the CWC's forecast sites (List will be shared) with readily available imageries. Participants can also seek to add value by incorporating tools for making critical infrastructure, filtering outliers, pointing out accuracy levels of projected inundation, etc.

## 25. **Threat zone of an explosion particularly in oil and gas handling industries or refineries**
Development of software for Indian physical territory containing exact geographical locations of all hazardous locations which contain potential risk to damage and destroy human life, property, and environment on a huge sale. This software should be able to find out the area or more precisely the threat zone in which the radiations and blast waves of an explosion will spread to damage its surrounding locality.  It's been observed in many explosions and fires in industries, say according to the official report of Jaipur IOCL Fire' by 'SK ROY, GM (ISE), CO INDIAN OIL CORPORATION LIMITED, held on 29 October 2009, where the fire following an explosion in a tank caused 9 tanks out of 11 to explode drastically after the first explosion and the fire continues to spread it's havoc for a sum total of 11 days and no fire personnel, experts and fire services could suggest ways to put off the fire and the fire extinguished by itself after the crude oil(fuel in the tanks on fire) gets totally burned. According to this report, later MB LAL Committee provided 118 recommendations for oil installations but the fighting capabilities cannot be utilized if they can not be directed through the right way and direction of approach towards the fire.  The above example shows that even if we have sufficient firefighting resources but if they approach the fire from the wrong direction say from a direction or zone where radiation is at its peak or from where the efficiency of firefighting will be least the available resources are of no use.  One should know the zone affected by the fire and the area where the radiations will be very high, high, medium, or low i.e. areas could be distinguished according to the radiations and potential to damage the human, flora, and fauna of the locality present in that threat zone. If a fire will be tackled from the right direction it can be extinguished in a more efficient manner with the least use of resources, and the least wastage of resources, within the least time.  One of the most useful advantages of such software is that it can be used to evacuate people and animals from areas with disastrous exposure to radiation so that more and more lives can be saved until the fire will be extinguished or under control.

A training resource manual titled 'Phonics and phonological processing to Develop Literacy and Articulation-Preliteracy and Articulation drill book' contains the sounds of Hindi in isolation and in different words across all word positions. The same can be used to develop software for training individuals in perception and production intervention. Given that the majority of the Indian population is in the rural regions and human resources are in the urban regions, this software can help bridge the gap and serve the un-served population. The software can be used to give visual and auditory stimulation and feedback and can help track progress. The training can be more intense with short frequent sessions, and flexible timings.  · Detailed description: Motor-based Intervention generally includes perceptual and production training and both can be incorporated into the same software. Perceptual training also called ear training involves teaching their clients to perceive the distinction between the target and error sounds. Through software, the child can be presented with a variety of correct and incorrect real-speech examples of the target phoneme and can be asked to make judgments about whether the production was correct. The software can also provide visual feedback about the accuracy of the child's judgment. The software can also track the child's success rate to assist the clinician in monitoring progress. Production of a target sound can be done using imitation, phonetic placement, successive approximation (shaping), and contextual utilization. All of these can be achieved using the software specifically developed for its use. For eg: Imitation: Several auditory models of the sound in isolation, syllables, or words can be provided. The child can be asked to watch and listen to the video that shows the 3-  dimensional image of the sound /word being produced and then can be asked to repeat the same. The client's production can also be recorded for self-feedback. Phonetic Placement When the client is unable to imitate a target sound, cues or instructions regarding where to place his or her articulators can be provided. Use of camera to serve as a mirror, images showing the placement, and videos showing the placement and movement during articulation can be developed. The videos would be 3 dimensional and could involve sound in isolation and word level.  Contextual utilization Involves isolating a target sound from a particular phonetic context in which a client may happen to produce a sound correctly, even though he or she typically produces the sound in error. Eg: The child can say 'bright sun', but cannot produce's' in other context. Slowly introduce other context through the software and then progress to production of's' in isolation. · Description of the Solution: For instance, the child needs to be taught the pronunciation of the syllable /ka/. 1. The word 'cat' is projected along with the picture. 2. As we tap the word, /kæt/ is heard. This forms the auditory cue. 3. The placement of the tongue in the oral cavity and as its changes when the syllables /ka/ /æ/ and /t/ are pronounced is presented on the animation. This provides a visual cue. 4. Production of Isolated syllables eg. /ka/ in this case, can also be shown. 5. The tongue movements inside the oral cavity can be shown in slow motion as well. A total of 2-13 such words for each phoneme(depending on the frequency of occurrence of phoneme in the language) , with each word having a maximum of 5 syllables can be shown to explain the articulatory pattern. The software can be developed in both Indian English and in Hindi, based on the data set.

The Luster and specific gravity of the sample also play a crucial role in the identification of core rock samples with respect to dimensions. The geological discontinuities are identified on the basis of fractures, joints, and litho-contacts. Hence, the development of a device assembly, that scans the drill core rock sample and identity the lithology and geological discontinuities on the basis of above said parameters by the artificial intelligence with given standards.

## 48. **Application for Assessment of Quality of Textbook/ Reference Books/ E- Book**
The medical students aiming to be good physicians, need to select a standard medical textbook. It is evident that there are several books made available in ASU (Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha) medical systems and every book claims that the book has been written as per CCIM or NCISM syllabus. Amongst some are good and some are of poor quality and were written with vested interest. Due to this, students are trapped by substandard books that leads to poor quality standard among students. Identifying this issue and its impact on medical on the medical system, NCISM constituted an expert committee for the development of an assessment scale for textbooks/ reference books. The expert committee after thorough deliberations developed the assessment scale for the quality assessment of textbooks/ reference books. This assessment scale serves the purpose of:- •Selection of quality textbooks by teachers for their students. Serving as a reference for textbook writers. • Providing criteria to recommend for inclusion in the list of recommended apex/ regulatory bodies. The assessment process requires a review of the books by reviewers (subject-wise reviewers located across the country, 3 reviewers per book) and summarizing the reviewer's remarks and decision by the committee. The development of an application on this will help to get reviews from people around the world online and also will help to summarize all the reviewed data in a faster mode.

## 50. **Development of a prototype instrument (sensor based) for assessment and quantification of rasas (taste) in crude herbs.**
Every herb used in the Ayurveda possesses some Taste (Rasa) and most important of them are -Madhura (Sweet). Amla (Sour), Katu (Pungent), Tikta (Bitter), Kashaya (Astringent). The rational application of herb in management of various diseases also depends on selection of herbs as per their rasa (Taste) as rasa (Taste) has the potential to effect the physiology of human body. Further, the same principle also applied for dietary items for their use in health management In fact, management of physiological units Vata, Pitta or Kapha (Body humors) may also be done on rational application of dravyastmaterials of dietary and medicinal value) based on rasa (taste). However, it is simple to identify rasa (taste) through tongue but it is not possible to quantify Further, the potency of herbs also depends on its rasa. Thus, quantification of rasa (taste) in crude herbs is also needed for quality assessment of crude herbs. Solution Need to develop an instrument (Tongucometer) which can quantify the Taste (rasa)-(Madhura (Sweet), Amla (Sour), Katu (Pungent), Tikta (Bitter), Kashaya (Astringent)) present in the materials used as diets and medicine through a sensor-based instrument?""

## 51. **Identification of Different Medicinal Plants/Raw materials through Image Processing Using Machine Learning Algorithms**
ndia, with a rich heritage of floral diversity, is well-known for its medicinal plant wealth, but their identification is one of the major burning issues in Ayurvedic Pharmaceutics. Several crude drugs are being sold under the same name in the market leading to confusion and their misidentification. Even the collectors and traders are not completely aware of the exact morphological appearance or differentiating attributes of the many drugs owing to seasonal and geographical availability, and similar characteristics. Moreover, the extensive consumption to meet demand-supply ratio exerts a heavy strain on the existing resources. It further leads to the practice of adulteration, substitution, and disbelief in the curative capability of the system eventually. Thus, software capable of identifying different medicinal plants/ raw materials through Image Processing Using Different Machine Learning Algorithms will be of immense use. It will be helpful at every level viz. wholesaler, distributor, etc. of the supply chain of raw material being utilized in the system.

## 52. **Al-based tool for preliminary diagnosis of Dermatological manifestations**
The Global Burden of Disease project has shown that skin diseases continue to be the 4th leading cause of nonfatal disease burden worldwide. These conditions are often the presenting face of more severe systemic illnesses, including HIV and neglected tropical diseases (NTD). such as elephantiasis and other lymphedema-causing diseases. Additionally, skin disorders pose a significant threat to patients' well-being, mental health, ability to function, and social participation. However, it is very difficult to provide better dermatological care to under-served or resource-poor regions in a cost-effective manner owing to unavailability of efficient diagnostic tools, lack of connectivity, and poor laboratory infrastructure etc. Moreover, there is also a scarcity of physicians with dermatological training. Even, preliminary screening of a dermatological manifestation seems to be an arduous task. Thus, developing an Artificial intelligence-based tool (through Image processing technique) for preliminary diagnosis of numerous dermatological conditions will prove to be a boon in the health care system.

## 54. **Chatbot to Known Individual Prakriti (Phenotype)**
Ayurveda is a natural health care system that emphasizes the treatment of disease in a highly individualized manner as it believes that every individual is unique having a different constitution. It classifies all individuals into different 'Prakruti' types based on the theory of tridosha and each type has a varying degree of predisposition to different diseases. This is independent of racial, ethnic, or geographical considerations. Knowing which particular Prakruti one belongs to, enables them to decide the preference of food which suits them best. By following the rules and regulations regarding food and lifestyle, one can prevent themselves from getting inflicted with various diseases. But, Prakruti assessment is a tedious process that requires the individual to visit the physician followed by a long list of questions in order to reach a conclusion. In order to make this process more convenient, the development of a self- assessment tool with the help of artificial intelligence may prove to be a stepping stone. A Chatbot which has pre-recorded questionnaire may help in the Prakruti assessment depending upon the responses given by an individual.

## 55. **A software that suggests drugs and formulations for a disease/pharmacological property based on the Ayurvedic classical books/Repositories.**
Ayurveda has a large database of single herbs, minerals, and formulations that have been tailormade to suit each individual, his/her psychosomatic constitution, clinical condition, comorbidities, age, region, etc. These data are spread over more than 150 texts, amidst manuscripts in multiple languages and scripts. With the rise of transcriptional and translational facilities, several traditional medicinal texts are now available in their digitized forms. But for an Ayurvedic student or practitioner, exploring this multitude of literature for identifying their ""drug of choice' often becomes tedious and impractical. Here is the need of a custom software that can identify the apt formulation that has been designed to treat a constellation of symptoms and present it to the student/practitioner along with its reference and other desired properties. For example, the two formulations Punarnavadi Kashaya and Vyaghryadi Kashaya are mentioned in texts as follows: Both these are decoctions advised in Jvara (fever) and Kasa (cough). But in a patient with upper respiratory tract infections like common cold (Pinasa), Vyaghryadi would suit better than Punarnavadi. Whereas in a condition associated with inflammatory changes all over the body. I Punarnavadi would be the appropriate choice. The objective of the proposed software is to identify the single drugs and formulations that suit a set of symptoms. Certain ingredients (eg. jaggery) are unsuitable for certain categories of patients (e.g. diabetics). There are also medicine mediums that are unsuitable for specific diseases (e.g. fermented/alcoholic preparations in diabetes). Such information is also expected to be conveyed to the learner or practitioner who uses the software. The same disease has been mentioned in different names (E.g. Jvara and Santapa for fever) and the same word has been used to denote different (Eg. Abhaya generally means Terminalia chebula but in the context of Jatyadi ghrita, it means Vetiveria zizanioides. The multiple names of same diseases are expected to be included in the tags of each formulation. The sources for the formulations, and synonyms and similar words have been included in the data section. It is also desirable to include the Ayurvedic pharmacological properties of the single drugs, and the compound formulation (called Rasa, Guna, Virya, Vipaka, etc.) as and where available.

## 57. **Using existing CCTV network for crowd management, crime prevention, and work monitoring using AIiML**
The Indian Railways is one of the largest railway networks in the world, serving millions of passengers daily. However, with the increasing number of passengers and trains, the management of railway stations and trains has become a challenge, especially when it comes to crowd management, cleanliness, crime prevention, and work monitoring. The traditional methods of manual monitoring and surveillance are time- consuming, and human error can lead to missed incidents. The integration of AI and ML technology can help the Indian Railways to overcome these challenges. Al-based CCTV networks can analyze large amounts of data in real-time and provide insights into crowd management, crime prevention, and work monitoring. This can improve the safety and security of passengers, as well as the efficiency of railway operations. For example, AI algorithms can detect unusual behavior and alert security personnel, while ML algorithms can predict crowd patterns and help with resource allocation. However, implementing Al-based GCTV networks requires a significant investment in technology and infrastructure, as well as the development of data management systems that can handle the large amount of data generated by these systems. Additionally, privacy and ethical considerations must be taken into account to ensure that the use ofAI technology does not infringe on the rights ofpassengers or workers. In conclusion, the use of AI and ML technology in the analysis of existing ccrv networks of the Indian Railways can bring about significant benefits for crowd management, crime prevention, and work monitoring. However, careful planning and implementation are required to ensure that these benefits are realized while respecting the privacy and ethical concerns ofstakeholders

## 75. **Real time monitoring of infrastructure development**
Today, each sector, such as education, health, agriculture, etc., is growing at a fast pace, and so is the infrastructure required for each sector. Developing infrastructure for each sector is a huge task and involves huge costs. Currently, a few tools are being used to monitor the day-to-day progress of the infrastructure, but they are all manual. This results in additional costs and the untimely completion of the infrastructural projects; thus, it affects the overall development of any sector. For further clarification, consider the infrastructure development associated with the education sector. If any government wants to set up a technical institute, it has to go through multiple processes, and one of the major processes is the timely establishment of the institute. With geo-tagging, it is possible to identify the chunk of land within the given location, district, town, etc., but the major challenge lies when it comes to the development of infrastructure. Currently, there is no mechanism available to monitor the progress on a real-time basis, so lots of manual intervention happens to monitor the progress. To overcome this issue, it is necessary to develop GIS and Al-based solutions through which real-time monitoring of the infrastructure can be done. Further, an application can also be developed that can work in both online and offline mode and through which day-to-day progress can be fed into the system. Thus, collected data can be populated into the system, and real-time monitoring using interactive dashboards and charts is possible. Further, the system will also provide flexibility to the user through simulation interference, which will help the user analyze the impact of an external factor on the time required for completion of the project.

## 76. **Community Based Reporting and Monitoring Tool for Women's Safety in Colleges/Universities.**
Campuses of colleges and universities are meant to be vibrant, free-flowing, and dynamic in nature. An accommodating campus supports idea exchange, personal growth, and soft skill development. The safety of students, especially women's students, is a pillar of an accommodating campus. In the present scenario, the measures available to college administrators and students, such as the installation of CCTV cameras, increased security on campuses, and the establishment of police outposts, are reactive in nature, i.e., they are pressed into action only after the occurrence of a mishap. The objective of the problem statement is to develop predictive analytic models to prevent mishaps even before they occur. The second issue pertaining to women's safety is the lack of manpower for proactive interventions to prevent mishaps. Another objective is to develop, monitor, predict, and provide actionable intelligence for the prevention of mishaps. The solution can explore the contours of anonymous and non-anonymous data collection mechanisms, point-to-point reporting systems, and predictive data analytics for providing actionable intelligence. Further, the collected data can be leveraged to develop and mark probable black spots and red time zones for pin-pointed actions to be taken by administrators. To promote a community-based system, the system may be designed in such a way that it not only gathers information from students but also involves the entire student community in the prevention of mishaps. The data collected from the participants can be populated into the system, and real-time monitoring can be done with an interactive dashboard and charts. It can also be used to develop real-time rapid intervention by the student community, college administration, and local authorities. Further to this, a companion model can also be developed for students that helps them travel through black spots and during red time zones. This will not only ensure the community participation of students but also develop a responsibility-sharing framework for campus safety.

## 77. **development of systems for effective Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Intervention in Higher Education**
It is well established that development towards a more sustainable society must begin with education. When education is done right, it not only teaches people about the science of climate change and inequality and the reasons we must take action, it also engages, empowers and promotes a more environmentally friendly, community-based way of life. ESG in higher education is one of least discussed aspects of governance among administrators. With the recent energy and climate crisis, administrators around the globe have realized the importance of sustainable process. The three pillars of ESG are people, processes, and product. In our case, people are the most important stakeholder in achieving our goal. Students from campuses of Higher Education are not only woke about the climate-energy crises but also are passionate for deigning a world of their future. Administrators on other hand are aware of the rising cost of energy and are open to adopting energy conservation and other aspects of ESG The objective of the problem statement solution shall be to create a common platform for planning, development, execution, and monitoring of ESG initiative. The initiatives may include adopting alternative sources of energy, development of energy efficient campuses, adopting green construction standards like GRIHA Prakriti and similar such initiatives. Another objective of the problem statement solution is to generate and produce dynamic dashboards which show targeted lacking areas as well as progress check for currently undertaken projects. The overall objective of the solution should be based on a collaborative effort between all the stakeholder for creating ESG framework in Higher Education. If executed effectively the solution will not only make a significance difference to the present scenario but also create a generation of environmentally and socially aware citizens with in depth knowledge on ESG issues. The solution should be in line with India's ambition of achieving its targets under COP 21 of Paris Agreement. It should also incorporate the best practice steps taken by governments like the International Solar Alliance. The overall objective of the solution shall be to develop a common monitoring dashboard for all ESG Initiatives taken by the state and predictive solution based on best practices across the globe.

## 131. **Similar Document Template Matching Algorithm**
In our organization, we encounter a significant challenge when dealing with a large volume of medical invoices, prescriptions, and lab test reports received from numerous providers, including doctors, hospitals, and labs, as well as from customers. To streamline our processes and improve efficiency, we aim to develop a system capable of extracting and standardizing these documents at a provider level. Additionally, we need to identify claims across different providers that exhibit similar document templates.  The primary issue we face stems from fraudulent customers who exploit identical digital or printed templates, with minor modifications such as changing the provider names, logos, colors, and text content positioning. By manipulating the customer details within these templates, they attempt to file reimbursement claims that are difficult to detect using standard document comparison checks.  To tackle this problem, we require the development of a robust Similar Document Template Matching Algorithm. This algorithm will automate the process of template extraction and standardization, allowing us to identify similarities and patterns across various documents. By comparing the templates used in different claims, we can effectively identify instances of potential fraud, even when the textual content has been altered.  The algorithm should be designed to handle a high volume of documents from diverse providers and customers. It should be capable of identifying commonalities in template structure, design elements, and formatting, while also accounting for variations resulting from legitimate differences between providers. Key objectives of the Similar Document Template Matching Algorithm:  1. Template Extraction: Develop a mechanism to extract and standardize templates from medical invoices, prescriptions, and lab test reports received from providers and customers. 2. Template Comparison: Implement an algorithm to compare and identify similarities among different document templates, accounting for minor modifications and variations in content. 3. Fraud Detection: Enhance the algorithm to flag instances of potentially fraudulent claims where similar templates are used, with modifications made to customer details while maintaining the overall structure and design. 4. Scalability and Efficiency: Ensure the algorithm can handle a large volume of documents efficiently, considering the growing number of providers and customers we deal with. 5. Flexibility: Design the algorithm to accommodate variations in template design and content across different providers, while maintaining the ability to detect fraudulent patterns  The successful development and implementation of the Similar Document Template Matching Algorithm will significantly enhance our ability to detect fraudulent claims and improve the overall accuracy and efficiency of our document processing workflows.  Theme: Fraud Detection & Document Templatization  Evaluation Criteria: The effectiveness of the Similar Document Template Matching Algorithm will be evaluated based on several key criteria. The primary criterion is the accuracy of detection, which measures the algorithm's ability to identify similarities in document templates accurately and efficiently. The algorithm should be able to detect instances where fraudulent customers exploit identical templates with minor modifications, distinguishing between suspicious and fraudulent documents.  To aid in the interpretation and communication of the algorithm's findings, the detected output should be represented using color-coded flags. Amber flags can be used to indicate suspicious documents that exhibit similarities in template structure or design elements, while red flags should be assigned to identify documents with high potential for fraud. This visual representation will assist investigators in prioritizing their efforts and taking appropriate actions.  Input Data Set: The team will have to generate their own dataset using publicly available datasets or archives. This approach ensures that the algorithm is exposed to a wide range of document templates from various providers and customers. The dataset should encompass different document types, such as medical invoices, prescriptions, and lab test reports, reflecting the real-world scenarios the algorithm will encounter during deployment.  By using this self-generated dataset, the algorithm can be trained and evaluated under realistic conditions. This approach enables the algorithm to learn patterns and similarities that exist in actual documents, allowing it to accurately detect fraudulent claims and identify suspicious patterns across different providers and customers.  Teams working on this problem statement are advised to create their own dataset to build and train their algorithms.

## 170. **Education ecosystem for specially abled student need provision and improvement to take care of compliance, governance and conduct.**
Children with disabilities in minor or major forms for any of the physical organs or mentally unstable children are considered to be specially-abled ones and to help them absorb the natural flow of life, we need to consider and provide them with a supportive and growing environment where they are able to live and grow. In the educational ecosystem, the needs of such an environment need to be catered according to the category of ailments that exist in the students and provisions need to be made in order to make them feel special, and cared for and set the right mindset while they grow.  There are very few educational institutes in India, that accept specially-abled students in regular streams making them feel one among natural children. The first and foremost need is to comply with the Disability Act provisions in the Indian education ecosystem and have the right provisions such as physical infrastructure, digital interaction pathways and the right tooling to make this happen in a much larger portion of the Indian education industry.  This problem statement hovers more around the lack of the right system and governance in the Indian Education industry and also has to deal with Disability students' intake, progress and outgo after the education completion. The State Education Report for India 2019: Children with Disabilities by UNESCO states that 27% of disabled children between the age of 5-19 years don't have access to education. It also says that nearly 3/4th of 5 years old specially-abled are left out of the education system, further revealing that this ratio varies gender-wise and girls tend to show in high numbers when it comes to depriving education. As per WHO report, over 1 billion people in the world are specially abled contributing to 15% of the total population and WHODAS 2.0 accessibility standards define means of assessing the disability in an individual, which ponder on a lot of aspects such as, it has been felt that differently-abled persons need special arrangements in the environment for their mobility and independent functioning.  It is also a fact that many institutes have architectural barriers that disabled persons find difficult for their day-to-day functioning. The colleges are expected to address accessibility-related issues as per the stipulations of the Persons with Disabilities Act 1995 and ensure that all existing structures as well as future construction projects in their campuses are made disabled-friendly. The institutes should create special facilities such as ramps, rails and special toilets, and make other necessary changes to suit the special needs of differently-abled persons. The construction plans should clearly address the accessibility issues pertaining to disability. Guidelines on accessibility are laid out by the office of the Chief Commissioner of Disabilities.  Consciously improving Education for specially-abled children will need planned efforts with the help of technology and human power. This makes the problem statement quite challenging and critical to be addressed the special compliance and governance needs. This problem statement needs holistic solutions that may be hybrid in nature. The objective of this problem statement in one way could be the right implementation of the Disability Act and the provisioning of digital infrastructure and applications to address the needs and feedback mechanisms. Facilitate admission of differently-abled persons in various courses, provide guidance and counselling to differently-abled individuals, Create awareness about the needs of differently-abled persons, and other general issues concerning their learning. Assist differently-abled graduates to gain successful employment in the public as well as private sectors, designing special interaction gateways for such children and helping them feel natural while growing is important.  Further, the objective is to come up with ways and means to make meaningful digital application/s that can use this information and generate knowledge, spread massive awareness, and support the intake and management of specially-abled children into the educational ecosystem. The objective of this problem statement solution is also to come up with innovative solutions which may use digital and physical mediums together to make sure disabled persons are able to access and operate these applications. The solution may use technologies like Artificial intelligence, machine learning and internet of things and blockchain to ensure specially-abled children are given the right systems to get into the mainstream of education, sustain with growth aspects and be placed well after their education is completed. It is all about following laws and legal procedures to comply with the Disability Act and make sure the system is governed well for specially-abled people's needs in their complete education lifecycle.

## 171. **Development of Virtual Reality (VR) technology for Dhatuposhana Nyaya**
There are primerly three tissue nourishment theories known as 'Dhatuposhan Nyaya described by Acharya's. They are as follow: 1. Ksheeradadhi Nyaya (Theory of Transformation)- This is compared to the conversion of milk (ksheera) into curd (dadhi) in entirety. This complete transformation of one Dhatu to another is called Sarvatma Parinama (total bio- conversion). According to this theory, nutrients getting converted into tissues. 2.Kedarikulya Nyaya (Theory of Transportation)- According to this theory, nourishment of the tissues can be compared to irrigation of fields by water from a canal. This explains supply of nutrients through circulatory system. 3.Khalckapota Nyaya (Theory of Selection)- Like pigeons pecking the grains from a threshing floor and carrying it back to their nests depend on the direction and the time required for them to travel. The nutrition required by a dhatu (tissue) is selected from the essence part of food being circulated. To understand and apply these principles/process at tissue level scientifically Virtual Reality (VR) technology may be helpful.

## 172. **Blended Learning to overcome inadequate infrastructure**
Once the class size passes a certain point, the teachers are bound to 'fail' because the demands on their time cannot be met. In essence, the root of this problem is not the number of children in a classroom but rather the inability for each child to receive adequate attention. Combining modern technology and 1:1 tuition, students could perform far beyond other students who were being taught in more conventional ways. By combining blended learning (where face-to-face teaching is combined with online learning) with real-time data, we can get rapid feedback in classrooms and use that feedback to further enhance the quality of education.  As an example, consider a classroom of 30 students. Ten students with similar abilities may work closely with the teacher, another ten may work through lectures and online tasks using computer terminals, and the final ten may work together on a group project. In the next lesson, students are rotated so they can learn in different ways throughout the course. This kind of approach enables the teacher to focus more closely on fewer children at once. The teacher can also tailor the learning approach for each student based on how well each one works for the individual. Meanwhile, the software on the computer is advanced enough to tailor the content to each student as well. By collecting real-time feedback on each child's results, the course contents can be adapted per student and make it as if they were receiving a one-on-one tuition. This approach allows each student to have their own learning path that's customized to their needs. By doing this, teachers can easily see which students are falling behind and offer more individualized teaching to those students.  If more schools were to adopt a similar approach, where some responsibilities could be handled by tech-aided learning methods, more of the teachers' time could be freed-up to give more attention where it's needed the most, even in larger classroom sizes. Further the objective is to come up with ways and means to make meaningful digital application's that can use this information and generate knowledge, spread massive awareness, and support education delivery effectiveness of students into educational ecosystem and generate insights based on data it collected. The objective of this problem statement solution is also to come up with innovative solution which may use digital and physical medium together to make sure specially abled students who are slow learners are identified, their progress is monitored and right alarms and notifications are generated to assist keeping their education on track with elevated motivation. The solution may use technologies like Artificial intelligence, machine learning and internet of things and blockchain to ensure specially abled children are given right systems and interfaces to learn and grow. This solution's objective is to make sure learning becomes seamless and peaceful with right insights and aids for the children.

## 173. **Capacity building, performance assessment and motivation driven tool for faculty upgradation**
If teachers were given more freedom, as would likely happen if a blended learning model were introduced as mentioned above, innovation would rocket, and an education system overhaul isn't exactly necessary to accomplish that. After all, there are (and will always be) plenty of options open to teachers to introduce more creativity and innovation to their lessons. Some of the options include Learning Management System (LMS), which allows teachers to create their own personalized, interactive courses from content provided by a range of publishers. Students can then access these courses on any device, while the app keeps a record of how they are progressing. If students are struggling. the course can quickly be altered. If students struggle with boredom, game-based learning can be introduced with LMS. Although granting teachers access to tablets and smartboards may help boost their comfort with education technology, many teachers simply have not thought about how they can best utilize technology in their curriculum. Indeed, the way a history teacher utilizes laptops in the classroom may be very different than the way a math teacher utilizes a smartboard. Both likely require plenty of time for trial, error, and experimentation to bring their lesson plans up to date. A major challenge in the adoption of new tools is not providing teachers with the guidance they need to make education technology work for them in their specific classroom. To overcome the challenge, it is necessary to have ERP solution for the teachers with adequate credit mechanism which can used for appraisals and performance-based incentives to the teachers.

## 178. **Land profiling of Asset Creation process**
There are various types of permissible works being taken up under the Mahatma Gandhi NREGS which are earthwork related works which requires excavation/land cuttin& land filling land levelling etc. As per the current practice of execution of the works under the scheme, there is a photograph taken of the worksite before initiating the work and the estimated quantity of the work to be executed in form of technical design & estimate. During the stages of execution, the technical person/engineer in-charge of the site, maintains the work done on site in form of measurements in the measurement book and accordingly the payment of the labour & material is generated. lt becomes difficult to ascertain the exact work done on ground during the audit/inspections after the work completion. A land profile of the worksite (in terms of contour levels or 3D modelling) before initiating the work and after work completion can provide a necessary information to derive the actual work done through analysing the land profiles in 3 dimensions (3D1. The profiles can be generated in reference to a fixed benchmark level available on the worksite. ln this regard a technology driven solution for 3D Profiling may be provided.

## 180. **Smart and Effective realtime Management of street parking**
ln lndia, the number of vehicles is constanfly on the rise, while the availability of parking space in cities has not kept pace with the increasing vehicle numbers, primarily due to the rapid groMh in population. Consequenfly, issues such as traffic congestion, narrowed streets due to on-street parking, a mismatch between parking supply and demand, and illegal parking have become all too familiar in lndian cities. Parking space has become a scarce commodity, and instead of simply increasing the number of available parking spaces, it is crucial to employ effective technology-based solutions to optimize their utilization. Smart parking solutions, utilizing sensors and software, can provade realtime information on available parking spaces to both city officials and drivers. Furthermore, leveraging emerging technologies can help optimize parking prices. A low parking price may encourage more vehicles on the road, leading to increased air and noise pollution, whereas too high prices may generate less revenue and less efectuve resource usage.Apart from the loss of revenue for operators, there is economic downside to the business in vicinity, effect on government taxes, employment.At the same parking space area and costs also have a corelation to balance optimum usage and revenue. Therefore, setting the right price for parking based on demand and optimizing occupancy is the best approach. The primary objective of the solution should be to equip city administrators with an effective parking management tool that can predict, manage, and finance parking in cities. An app should be developed to allow citizens to conveniently reserve pce king spots and make payments based on dynamic pricing This not only saves citizens' time spent searching the parking but also reduces environmental degradation resulting from congestion caused by parking and provides a sustainable source of revenue for the city administration. We need an innovative, simple and widely coveraged parking needs in the city and also become most compliant for Traffic and mobility needs.

## 181. **Suggest an Al-based solution to enable ease of grievance lodging and tracking for citizens across multiple departments**
A robust grievance redressal mechanism is a crucial component of any administration. An efficient and effective procedure for addresstng grievances demonstrates an administration's accountability responsiveness, and user-friendliness. However, the ease of lodging a complaint or grievance by citizens is often lacking in many lndian cities. Given the large migratory population in tndian cities, consisting of individuals who may not be familiar with English, Hindi, or the local regional language, citizens face challenges in lodging their grievances. Moreover, the process of lodging a gflevance is not always straightforward. Some department websites are inaccessible, and locating the correct website for a specific department can be difficult. lntroducing an Al-based chatbot that allows citizens to dictate their grievances in their local language and lodge them, would greatly assist citizens. This tool should be able to understand and process complaints effectively, assign them to the relevant department, and provide citizens with a unique complaint number. Real-time updates on the status of the complaint should be sent to citizens, enabling one-on-one conversations throughout the grievance lifecycle. The primary objective of this solution should be to provide citizens with an easy-to_use chatbot that facilitates efficient lodging and tracking of grievances. This would not only save citizens' time in searching for the appropriate department or category but also enabl; the administration to receive targeted grievances and enhance overall service delivery.
